/**
 * One resident reduced-state fold per (store, path), shared by every reader
 * and by the instance's writer.
 *
 * Reads served from a host fold only the batches appended since the last
 * call instead of replaying the stream from the origin; the writer adopts
 * its post-append state into the same host, so on a warm instance the writer
 * and all readers reference a single state object.
 *
 * The host is fold-only: it never creates streams and never acquires the
 * producer, so a read can never fence out a live writer (acquiring the
 * producer bumps the epoch; on Node several processes hold claims over one
 * store). The cached state is exactly what a from-scratch
 * `loadReducedConversationState` produces at the same offset — including for
 * streams that do not exist, where both yield an empty state and callers
 * detect absence via `getMeta`, as today.
 *
 * Failure atomicity mirrors the writer's incremental path: new batches fold
 * into a clone and the reference swaps only on success, so a poisoned batch
 * fails the request loudly and leaves the cached state intact. Entries are
 * keyed by stream incarnation — a store that was wiped and regrown discards
 * the cached fold.
